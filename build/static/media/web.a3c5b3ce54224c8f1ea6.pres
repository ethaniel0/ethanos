It features a fully functional command line, which can be accessed through the terminal and by the OS and other apps. Each application has a separate file and can open with a save file - as is done with the Present application. The background was also custom-made made using Perlin Noise. I had a lot of fun making it, and i hope you enjoy it too!",

Parents often fear that their baby is going to crawl out, fall, and hurt themself. To help with this struggle, our team created a camera that mounts to the crib and detects if the baby is trying to crawl out. If the server detects that the baby might be in danger of crawling out, it'll immediately text and notify the parents, so they can stop their baby before anything bad happens. There's also an online portal so parents can watch their baby in real time.",
